    fullContent: `Dreaming of a brighter smile? Professional teeth whitening treatments are available, but nature offers powerful solutions too. Foods like strawberries, apples, celery, carrots, and dairy products such as yogurt and cheese can help remove stains and promote oral health. Strawberries contain malic acid, which acts as a natural astringent to remove surface stains. Apples and celery increase saliva production, which helps clean teeth naturally. Carrots are rich in fiber, aiding in scrubbing away plaque, while dairy products provide calcium and phosphates that strengthen enamel. Incorporate these foods into your diet for a naturally brighter smile!`,
